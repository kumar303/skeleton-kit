# skeleton-kit

This is a toolkit for creating near pixel-perfect skeleton screens.

## Features

This is very much a work in progress. Here is the envisioned feature set:

- [ ] React skeleton text
- [ ] React Native skeleton text
- [x] Modern code base: TypeScript, React hooks

## Development

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) then type this to install all dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Run the test suite as you edit files:

```
yarn test --watch
```

Start a [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server:

```
yarn storybook
```

Check for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) errors as you edit files:

```
yarn tsc -w
```

## Alternatives

- [react-native-skeleton-content](https://github.com/alexZajac/react-native-skeleton-content) is a React Native libary that adapts to layouts in a similar manner
- [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton) adapts to web layouts but is limited in what it can do
